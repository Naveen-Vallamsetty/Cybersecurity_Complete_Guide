MINDSET — BECOME A HACKER FIRST, TO LEARN HACKING
Before we learn tools or skills, let’s build the "Hacker Mindset":

“How can I break this system?”

“If I were a bad guy, how would I sneak in?”

"If I were the admin, how do I block it?"

🌌 WHAT IS A HACKER MINDSET?
It’s not just using tools like Nmap or Burp Suite — it’s how you think.

“Every system is breakable. My job is to understand it deeply and find the weak point.”
— Guru Hacker Law
