# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Journey ‚Äì Day 1: Networking Fundamentals

## üß† What is a Computer Network?

A computer network is a system that connects multiple devices (computers, servers, routers, etc.) to share information and resources efficiently. It includes:

- **Physical connections** ‚Äì cables, switches, routers
- **Logical connections** ‚Äì IP addressing, routing, protocols

## üåê Types of Computer Networks (Based on Size)

| Type     | Description                                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **PAN**  | Personal Area Network ‚Äì short range (e.g., Bluetooth devices)            |
| **LAN**  | Local Area Network ‚Äì within a building (e.g., home, office)              |
| **WLAN** | Wireless LAN ‚Äì LAN using wireless tech like Wi-Fi                        |
| **CAN**  | Campus Area Network ‚Äì connects LANs within a campus                      |
| **MAN**  | Metropolitan Area Network ‚Äì spans a city                                 |
| **WAN**  | Wide Area Network ‚Äì covers large geographical areas (e.g., the internet) |

## üß± Network Architecture

- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)** ‚Äì each node is equal and communicates directly
- **Client-Server** ‚Äì centralized server provides services to clients

---

## üîÅ Network Protocols

- **Physical Protocols** ‚Äì define electrical/physical specifications (e.g., Ethernet)
- **Logical Protocols** ‚Äì define logical communication and data formats (e.g., TCP/IP)

## üìä OSI Model (Reference Model by ISO, 1977)

The OSI model has 7 layers and is used to conceptualize how data travels across a network.

| Layer           | Data Unit | Description                               |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 7. Application  | Data      | User interface, application services      |
| 6. Presentation | Data      | Data translation, encryption, compression |
| 5. Session      | Data      | Session control, dialogs                  |
| 4. Transport    | Segment   | Reliable delivery (TCP), error recovery   |
| 3. Network      | Packet    | Routing, logical addressing (IP)          |
| 2. Data Link    | Frame     | MAC addressing, error detection           |
| 1. Physical     | Bit       | Transmission of raw bits                  |

- The **upper layers (5‚Äì7)** = Host layer
- The **lower layers (1‚Äì4)** = Media layer

> Note: OSI is a reference model. Actual implementations use the TCP/IP model.

## üåê TCP/IP Model (Real-world implementation)

| Layer             | Purpose                      | Example Protocols |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Application       | End-user services            | HTTP, FTP, DNS    |
| Transport         | End-to-end connection        | TCP, UDP          |
| Internet          | Logical addressing & routing | IP, ICMP          |
| Network Interface | Physical transmission        | Ethernet, ARP     |

## üßæ IP vs MAC Address

| Property | IP Address               | MAC Address                       |
| -------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Type     | Logical (Software-level) | Physical (Hardware-level)         |
| Scope    | Changes across networks  | Permanent (NIC-specific)          |
| Use Case | Routing over networks    | Device identification within LANs |

## üîÅ Duplex Communication Modes

- **Simplex** ‚Äì one-way (e.g., keyboard to CPU)
- **Half-Duplex** ‚Äì both ways, but one at a time (e.g., walkie-talkie)
- **Full-Duplex** ‚Äì simultaneous two-way communication (e.g., phone)

---

## üõ∞Ô∏è Transmission Types

- **Unicast** ‚Äì One-to-one
- **Multicast** ‚Äì One-to-many (selected)
- **Broadcast** ‚Äì One-to-all (within a LAN)

## üîå Network Topologies

### Wired Topologies:

| Type     | Description                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Bus**  | Single backbone, terminators at each end |
| **Ring** | Data travels in a loop                   |
| **Star** | Central hub connects all nodes           |
| **Mesh** | Every node connected to every other      |

### Wireless Topologies:

| Type               | Description                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Ad-hoc**         | Devices connect directly without infrastructure |
| **Infrastructure** | Devices connect via Access Point                |
| **Wireless Mesh**  | Nodes dynamically connect and reconfigure       |
