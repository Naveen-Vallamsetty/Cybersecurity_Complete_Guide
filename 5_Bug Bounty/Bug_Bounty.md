✅ Read 1 Bug Bounty report daily from https://hackerone.com/hacktivity

🔎 HOW TO READ BUG BOUNTY REPORTS (Like a Pro)
Step-by-step Method:
Go to https://hackerone.com/hacktivity

Click any public disclosure like:

“XSS in profile name”

“SQL Injection in search”

Break the report into 4 parts:

Part What to Read

1. Summary What was the vulnerability type? (e.g., IDOR, XSS)
2. Steps to Reproduce What exact steps were used to find and exploit the bug?
3. Impact What did the attacker achieve (account takeover, data leak)?
4. Fix / Remediation What did the company do to fix it?

🔍 Learn These Terms:
IDOR = Insecure Direct Object Reference

CSRF = Cross Site Request Forgery

SSRF = Server Side Request Forgery

Stored/Reflected XSS

CVSS Score = Severity Score

🧠 How to Read As:
Attacker: How did I spot this? What did I test?

Defender: How do I prevent this? What was missing (validation, auth)?

✍️ How to Practice Writing Reports:
Solve a vulnerable lab (TryHackMe, DVWA, HackTheBox)

Write:

Title: SSRF via Image Upload

Impact: Server can be tricked into accessing internal resources

Steps to Reproduce: Bullet steps

Proof of Concept (PoC): screenshot or curl request

Fix: Validate URL, block internal IPs

🎯 Post it in GitHub or Medium: “My First Vulnerability Report”

🎯 Bug Example:
📄 Title: “Someone can take over your account if the password reset link is leaked!”

📘 The Story of Alice, Bob, and the Hacker
🧒 Alice forgets her password on a shopping website.

🛍️ She clicks “Forgot Password”, and the website sends her a secret link in her email.

➡️ Example:
https://shopping.com/reset-password?token=ABC123

🧑‍💻 But when Alice clicks the link, something dangerous happens.

🚨 Problem:
The link she clicked was shared accidentally with other services on the internet.
Like:

Google Analytics

Facebook Pixel

Other Ad Trackers

Why?

Because browsers tell the last link (Referrer) they came from when loading things like images or JavaScript. It's like saying:

“Hey Google! I just came from this page: https://shopping.com/reset-password?token=ABC123”

👿 The hacker checks the logs of that tracker and sees this token!
He uses it to click the link himself and reset Alice’s password.

🔍 Step-by-Step

Step What It Means

1. Vulnerability Type The website shared private info (token) in the URL, and it got leaked.
2. Reproduce the Bug (Try it Yourself) ✅ Try making your own local HTML page. Put this code inside:

html
Copy
Edit
<img src="https://shopping.com/reset-password?token=ABC123">
Then open this in your browser.
Use browser’s Network tab to see what Referrer it sends. |
| 3. Impact | Hacker gets full control of the user’s account. |
| 4. Fix | Website should not send secret info in the link. It should use a cookie or secure method. |

🛡️ Defender vs Attacker Thinking
Role What They Ask
🦹 Attacker "Where is this website leaking secrets? In headers? In URLs?"
🛡️ Defender "Are we sending sensitive data in a way others can see it? What do our logs show?"

# 🐞 Bug Bounty Report: Password Reset Token Leak

## 📘 Summary

The website leaked the password reset token in the URL. This token was shared in the HTTP Referer header with third parties.

## 🧪 Steps to Reproduce

1. Click "Forgot Password"
2. Get email with link like: `https://website.com/reset?token=ABC123`
3. Click the link and open Developer Tools → Network
4. Look at the request to Google Analytics — it includes the token!

## 💥 Impact

Full account takeover by anyone who sees the link.

## 🛠️ Fix

- Don't use tokens in URLs
- Use HTTP-only cookies
- Set `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` header

## 🧠 Hacker Mindset

"Where is sensitive data being sent secretly?"

## 📌 Severity: Critical
