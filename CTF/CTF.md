🕹️ HOW TO SOLVE A CTF BOX / CHALLENGE (TryHackMe or HackTheBox)
Think of CTFs (Capture The Flag) as virtual machines with hidden flags, and your job is to:

Discover it

Exploit it

Capture the flag

🌐 Platforms:
https://tryhackme.com — Great for beginners

https://hackthebox.com — Intermediate to advanced

https://picoctf.org — Good for puzzles & logic

🧪 CTF Workflow:
Step Task

1. Recon Use nmap to scan ports, services
2. Enumeration Check website, robots.txt, hidden pages
3. Exploitation Use known exploits, payloads
4. Privilege Escalation Gain root/system access
5. Flag Capture Read file like /root/root.txt or /home/user/user.txt

💡 Example: TryHackMe’s Simple CTF or Mr Robot box is a good first challenge.

🎯 The concept

🔧 The tool/command

🧠 What you learn

🛡️ How attackers use it

🛡️ How defenders prevent it

🎮 CTF Day 1: Meet Bob and the Login Panel (Basic Web CTF)
🖥️ Scenario (The Cartoon Story)
Meet Bob, a sleepy developer at a company. He made a login page:

http://bobscorp.com/login.php

But Bob made a small mistake. And you, Naveen the Baby Hacker 🧑‍💻, found his CTF box online.

🎯 Your mission: Break into Bob’s login panel and capture the flag.

🔎 Step 1: Information Gathering
You visit the website.

🧑‍💻 You see a simple login form asking:

Username

Password

👀 You inspect the HTML
Use browser > right-click > Inspect > Network and Elements.

💡 What to look for:

Hidden form fields?

JavaScript clues?

File paths?

🛠️ Step 2: Try Common Credentials
Let’s try:

Username Password
admin admin
admin 123456
bob password

👎 Nothing works.

🔧 Step 3: Try SQL Injection
You remember from your studies:

SQL Injection is like tricking the login box into thinking your username and password are always correct.

Try this in the login box:
vbnet
Copy
Edit
Username: ' OR 1=1 --
Password: (anything)

🧠 Why it works:

' OR 1=1 -- tells the SQL engine:

"Always true"

"Ignore the rest of the query"

🛡️ Real websites should prevent this using:

Prepared statements

WAF (Web Application Firewall)

Input validation

💥 Boom! You're in.

🏴 Step 4: Capture the Flag
Once logged in, the site says:

css
Copy
Edit
Welcome back, admin! Here’s your flag:
FLAG{bob_should_use_prepared_statements}
✅ Congratulations, Naveen! You completed your first CTF.

📘 What You Learned
Topic What You Did Tool/Skill
Recon Inspected login page Browser Dev Tools
Weak Auth Tried common creds Manual
SQL Injection Bypassed login form Your brain 🧠
Capture Flag Found hidden string Web browser
Hacker Mindset Thought “What if?” like a real attacker ✅

🧠 Mindset Note
Attackers always ask:

“What did the developer forget?”

“What happens if I put this?”

“Can I break the logic?”

🛡️ How to Defend (For Interview)
If an interviewer asks:

"How would you prevent this attack?"

You say:

Input validation

Prepared statements in backend

Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Proper error messages (don’t leak info)

🎯 Today, I completed my first web CTF!
I found an SQL Injection in a fake login page by bypassing the login with ' OR 1=1 --.
Learned about how attackers think and how developers can defend with secure coding.
One small mistake by a sleepy developer = one big opportunity for a hacker 🧑‍💻

🚀 Hands-On Lab
You can try real beginner CTFs here:

TryHackMe — start with:

“Burp Suite: Repeater”

“OWASP Juice Shop” (for SQLi)

HackTheBox Starting Point — login bypass + more

🧠 Baby Hacker Flow (SQLi Lab Practice)
Open a CTF box like TryHackMe “SQL Injection”

Right-click → Inspect → find login form

Try:

' OR 1=1 --

' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL --

Try to break it

Capture flag!

Scripting – Basic Python and Bash helps a lot!

The HTTP 204 status code, known as “No Content,” means that the server successfully processed the client's request but does not need to return any content.

A 301 status code in HTTP signifies a "Moved Permanently" redirect, indicating that a requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL. This code is crucial for maintaining search engine rankings and user experience when a page is relocated.

The HTTP 302 Found redirection response status code indicates that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to the URL in the Location header. A browser receiving this status will automatically request the resource at the URL in the Location header, redirecting the user to the new page.

A 307 status code, or HTTP 307 Temporary Redirect, indicates that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URL. The browser is instructed to follow this redirection, using the same HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) as the original request. Unlike 302 redirects, 307s strictly preserve the request method.

A 403 Forbidden status code is an HTTP status code that indicates the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. Essentially, the server knows who you are (you're authenticated), but you don't have the necessary permissions to access the requested resource. This differs from a 401 error, which indicates the client needs to authenticate or re-authenticate.
